## Introduction

The Maker Challenge is all about tinkering with hardware and building electronics in a fun and relaxed environment. This year, we challenge you to build an ESP32 device that responds to real-time phone calls or SMS using SignalWire APIs. Take it a step further and control your device through an AI agent.

## Getting Started

* If you don't already have a SignalWire account, follow this guide to create an account. https://developer.signalwire.com/platform/dashboard#get-started
* [Download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/)
* Grab a kit off of the table

## Code

1. Clone this repo! `git clone https://github.com/signalwire/ClueCon_Coder_Games.git`
2. `cd ClueCon_Coder_Games/2025/SignalWire_Maker_Challenge/voice/`
4. Open `voice_call_led_status.ino` in Arduino IDE
5. You should also have `credentials.h` in the tab next to `voice_call_led_status.ino`
6. Edit and save the variables located in `credentials.h`
7. Install Required libraries:
- ArduinoHttpClient
- ESPAsyncWebServer
- ArduinoJson
- WiFi Link
